# ITCS 4650 Senior Project

## About
Hello!  This is my senior project to complete my capstone requirement for my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  

**Goals**

* Design and develop an app that allowed users to create albums from photos and see the location of each image on a Google Map.

* Ability to learn new techniques and libraries for Android.

* Solidified my desire to learn more about mobile application development in my own time or as a career.

## The App

**Creating Album**

You have the ability to create an album to store local photos in.  Albums can be Public or Private based on user defined settings which allows them to be publicly searched for or not.  Creating an album with the same name as another will open the album with the current name.

**Adding Images**

Once you have created an album you will store photos from your local storage on your phone inside.  If you add an image that does not have an location associated with it, you will be prompted input where it was taken by using Google Places API. View your photos when you are done adding them to the album.

</p>

**Favoriting Albums**

Each album has many options for ease of access.  Favoriting an album allows for easy access to albums you frequent most.

</p>

**Map View**

View each album on a Google map to see where each picture was taken.  Clicking on the pins will display the image inside a small info window.  Clicking the info window image will open up an image viewer.  The image viewer is also accessible by clicking on pictures from inside the album.

</p>

**Album Search**

Search through your own or public albums.  Favorite public albums if you wish to easily view them later.

**Changing Themes**

The ability to change themes as I know people would have different preferences on what they like and don't like.
